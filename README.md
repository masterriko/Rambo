RogueRambo is a top-down, turn-based tactical game, similar to Rogue (1980). You play as Rambo, who must fight his way through the terrorist base.

The player can do the following during their turn:

- Get score for killing enemies

- Move up, down, left, or right.

- Shoot in the direction where he is turned.

- Reload their gun.

- The number of actions per turn is limited. After the player ends their turn, terrorists will move towards the player (if they have detected them) and may shoot.
